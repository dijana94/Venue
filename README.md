None of the above data is legitamate. This data was created for the purpose of this project and in no way represents real 
people. Except the first one; that's me.

Once logged in you may browse all events and filter them by Venue. You may see information about each event by clicking on it and 
you may buy tickets for it. From the home page or the dropdown Venues you may choose a specific Venue and see its information, such 
as map location, events being held and the option to book a table for a dinner. Table bookings do a couple of checks: (1) you may 
not reserve a table on the night of an event without buying a ticket first (2) if there is no space available at that time for your 
section you must change it. If it all checks out, your reservation is written into the database and you may view it and/or cancel it 
under the "Account" dropdown, along with any tickets you may have bought (separate list).
Overall, the website is self-explanatory and easy to follow. There are a number of issues/improvements to be made in the future, that 
were unable to get resolved by the project deadline.

When logged in as a manager one can add/remove venues, events, entertainment, tables, staff...
